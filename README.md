Assuming you have python and pip already installed in your local machine we are going to create a virtual enviornment to run the project, so firt open the Command Prompt.

If you don't have virtual enviorement already installed then run 

    $ C:\Users\MASTER>pip install virtualenv

Once it's intalled then we are going to create a new directory for the project where we will set the virtual enviornment

    $ C:\Users\MASTER>mkdir owlish
      C:\Users\MASTER>cd owlish

Now that we are in the project directory we create a virtual enviorment for it with the following command

    $ C:\Users\MASTER\owlish>virtualenv venv

So the virtual enviorment its created now we activate it with:

    $ C:\Users\MASTER\owlish>venv\Scripts\activate
